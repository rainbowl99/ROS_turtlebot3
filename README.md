# ROS_turtlebot3
This project is about using ROS (Robot Operating System) to control the Turtlebot 3 robot for autonomous navigation in a variety of challenging environments. The project consisted of three main challenges, each designed to test and demonstrate different navigation capabilities of the robot. Below is a summary of the main elements of the project:

Project Background and Objectives:

The project aims to control both simulated and real Turtlebot 3 robots to navigate in realistic challenge environments to get from a start position to a goal position.
The navigation task required the use of a camera to detect and follow a line, as well as the use of a laser scanner (LDS) to detect and avoid obstacles.
Challenge Overview:

Challenge 1: Following the line: this task requires the robot to move along a line in the environment while avoiding obstacles on the route.
Challenge 2: Moving in a corridor: this task requires the robot to navigate through a corridor with walls on both sides, relying heavily on data from the laser scanner.
Challenge 3: Navigating in a cluttered environment: In this challenge, the robot needs to navigate through an environment full of obstacles without touching any of them and reach the exit.
